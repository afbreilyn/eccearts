              Through music, we create a more culturally enlivened public, and at the same time, we challenge, innovate and invigorate our community by bringing music, dance, opera and collaborations with the visual arts to Cambridge, Boston, New York and beyond.

            <br />
            <p>
              Ecce is an efficient non-profit arts organization that spends almost its entire operating budget directly on the artists who perform and inspire. We count on your support so that we may in turn support the artists who bring such beauty and illumination to our communities.
